## About me

Hi, I’m Devika. Thank you for taking the time to visit the page and taking the interest to see what I’m about!

I want to start by mentioning I was brought up a vegetarian by my mother and that I haven’t always been vegan. She used to shout out ‘You’re vegetarian! Don’t pick the meat option!’ as I left for school in the mornings. I never really needed to question her ‘why?’ as it was simple. Why would I want to eat an animal? To me, there was nothing attractive about this.

But veganism was a different story as I never understood why people choose to be vegan. I thought no physical harm was being caused to the animals so what was the need to stop using dairy; secreting milk is a natural process right? I was under the impression that animals are not being murdered because of me so why do I have to worry or carry any guilt in using dairy products? Dare do I say I thought being vegan was ‘going too far!’

However, all of that changed in March 2016. I was browsing the internet and accidently came across a video about what dairy farming actually involved. What I witnessed was upsetting and went against all my morals. It was inhumane and made my heart ache. It woke up my inner emotions and made me question human morality. How and when did we, compassionate beings, who have been taught since birth to respect, care for and love all living beings become so desensitised towards earth’s animals?

To meet the consumer’s demand of dairy milk, dairy cows have to be forcibly impregnated every year through artificial insemination. This is to increase their efficiency. As soon as their calves are born they are taken away within 24-72 hours of birth so they do not ‘waste’ their mother’s milk as this would decrease profit. The separation of mother and baby, like humans, can be a very traumatic experience for both.

From this point forward the female calf will follow in its mother’s footsteps and become a milking machine for the dairy industry. Cows are modified to produce ten times more milk then they would naturally which can be painful for the cow. This over milking can cause infections and diseases. If that was not enough, they are slaughtered when they stop producing milk as they are of no use to the dairy business. This is normally after 4-5 years; a cow’s natural life span is an average 20 years.  Most cows are raised in intensive conditions were they do not get to see the outdoors. Some cows are also abused due to the stressful environment the farmers have to work in.

What I came to realise is that dairy cows and other farm animals are used as a commodity and not seen or treated as sentient beings. Could I really say I loved animals but also pay for them to be murdered? I would be a hypocrite if I said yes. If I cared for animals, then I cared for them all which meant I had to go vegan and start taking responsibility for my choices. This was not easy for me to accept as I had consumed dairy for 26 years but it was easy for me understand why I needed to stop. So that’s what I did. Was the transition easy? Not always but I learnt a lot along the journey. Do I have any regrets? The only regret I have is not going vegan sooner.
