## FAQ

### Why is plant based milk better?

The easiest way to explain why plant milk is better is by comparing it to what it is not; cow’s milk. To meet the demand of cow’s milk, dairy cows have to be forcibly impregnated every year through artificial insemination. As soon as their calves are born they are taken away within 24-72 hours of birth so they do not ‘waste’ their mother’s milk. Dairy cows are solely raised so they can provide milk to humans and later their meat and skin to humans. The separation of mother and baby, like humans, can be a very traumatic experience for both.

From this point forward the female calf will follow in its mother’s footsteps and become a milking machine for the dairy industry. Cows are modified to produce ten times more milk then they would naturally. This over milking can cause infections and diseases. If that was not enough, they are slaughtered when they stop producing milk as they are of no use to the dairy business. This is normally after 5 years. There natural life span is an average of 25 years.  Most cows are raised in intensive conditions were they do not get to see the outdoors. Some cows are also abused due to the stressful environment the farmers have to work in. So, why is plant is based milk better? Well, because it does not involve any of the processes listed above.

### Is the production of ahimsa milk sustainable?

Ahimsa milk is definitely a step up from using milk from factory farms. However, in the long run, it will all come down to supply and demand. If the demand for ahimsa milk increases it would mean more cows would be needed and more land would be acquired. How can you then ensure that the standard of care will still be as high as when they started? Let us assume that the care would remain the same, what would then happen to the ageing population of these cows? Will there be enough land available for the cows to roam? What would then happen to the male cows as they are not needed in the milking process? The use of ahimsa milk is a step towards better animal welfare but it is not a solution to the problem.

### Are there alternatives to cow’s milk?

Yes! There are many. They include soy milk, coconut milk, almond milk, flax milk, rice milk, cashew milk, hemp milk and many more. These are widely available from most local supermarkets.
